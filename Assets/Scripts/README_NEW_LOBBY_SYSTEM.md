## 🎯 What You Asked For

> *"Host clicks play, it starts hosting and goes to prep scene directly. In there host can use Steam friend list invite to invite users - we don't need lobby system. When a client joins it can be either prep scene or actual level scene. We can see the lobby on ESC menu, on the left side name, icon, and kick button if it is host."*

## 🚀 Next Steps (Unity Editor)

### Step 1: Create Pause Menu in PrepScene

1. Open `PrepScene.unity`
2. Create this hierarchy:

```
Canvas (if not exists)
└── PauseMenuRoot (GameObject)
    ├── Add Component: PauseMenuManager
    ├── Background (Image - black, alpha 0.8)
    └── ContentPanel
        └── LobbyPanel
            ├── Add Component: InGameLobbyPanel
            ├── Title (Text): "Connected Players"
            ├── PlayerListContainer (Empty GameObject)
            │   └── Add Component: Vertical Layout Group
            └── PlayerCountText (TextMeshPro)
```

3. **Configure PauseMenuManager**:
   - Assign `m_PauseMenuRoot` → PauseMenuRoot GameObject
   - Assign `m_LobbyPanel` → LobbyPanel GameObject
   - Set `m_PauseKey` → Escape
   - Set `m_PauseGameWhenOpen` → **false** (multiplayer game)

4. **Configure InGameLobbyPanel**:
   - Assign `m_PlayerListContainer` → PlayerListContainer Transform
   - Assign `m_PlayerCountText` → PlayerCountText
   - Set `m_MaxPlayers` → 4
   - Leave `m_PlayerEntryPrefab` → None (auto-generates UI)

5. **Set PauseMenuRoot inactive** in Inspector (unchecked)

### Step 2: Copy to Level Scene

1. Copy entire `PauseMenuRoot` GameObject
2. Paste into your level scene (SampleScene or whatever you use)
3. Done!

### Step 3: Test!

1. **Play in Editor** (Host)
   - Click "Host" button
   - Should immediately load PrepScene
   - Press ESC → See pause menu with your name

2. **Build and Run** (Client)
   - Or use ParrelSync for testing
   - Click "Join", enter host IP
   - Should join directly into PrepScene
   - Press ESC → See both players

3. **Test Kick**
   - Host presses ESC
   - Should see "Kick" button next to client
   - Click Kick → Client disconnects

## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### Connection Syncing
```
Server
  ↓ Spawns NetworkConnectionTracker
  ↓ Updates tracker.ConnectionCount when players join/leave
  ↓ SyncVar replicates to all clients
  ↓
Clients
  ↓ Receive connection count
  ↓ InGameLobbyPanel refreshes
  ↓ UI updates automatically
```

### Kick Flow
```
Host clicks Kick
  ↓ InGameLobbyPanel.OnKickButtonClicked()
  ↓ BarelyMovedNetworkManager.KickPlayer()
  ↓ NetworkConnectionToClient.Disconnect()
  ↓
Client disconnected
  ↓ Returns to main menu
  ↓ Server updates tracker
  ↓ All clients refresh UI
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the ESC menu"
- Check PauseMenuRoot has PauseMenuManager component
- Check m_PauseMenuRoot is assigned in Inspector
- Check Input System package is installed
- Try pressing ESC again

### "Player count shows 0/4"
- Check NetworkConnectionTracker is spawning (see console)
- Ensure server is active
- Check both host and client are connected

### "Kick button doesn't work"
- Ensure you're the host (crown icon should show)
- Check console for kick messages
- Verify player has NetworkIdentity

### "Client stuck in MainMenu"
- Ensure both PrepScene and MainMenu are in Build Settings
- Check NetworkManager scene sync is enabled
- Verify host successfully loaded PrepScene
