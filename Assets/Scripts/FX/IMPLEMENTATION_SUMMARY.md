### Files Modified

1. **`GrabbableItem.cs`**
   - Removed old VFX system (ShatterVFXSpawner)
   - Replaced `RpcPlayShatter` with `RpcFractureMesh`
   - Updated `ServerHandleBroken` to trigger fracturing
   - Added new Inspector settings:
     - Fracture Count (6-20 pieces)
     - Explosion Force
     - Explosion Radius  
     - Fragment Lifetime
   - Added mesh readability check
   - Proper material instancing

## 🎯 Features

### Realistic Fracturing
- **Plane-based slicing**: Uses multiple random cutting planes
- **Impact-biased**: Fracture patterns centered near hit point
- **Proper geometry**: Generates cap faces to seal cuts
- **UV mapping**: Maintains/generates texture coordinates

### Physics Simulation
- Each fragment is a real GameObject
- Full Rigidbody physics with collision
- Convex MeshCollider per fragment
- Mass based on fragment size
- Realistic tumbling and settling

### Performance Optimized
- Configurable piece count (6-20)
- Auto-cleanup after lifetime
- Efficient plane-based algorithm (2-5 cuts)
- Client-side only (not networked)

### Network Compatible
- Server triggers fracture via RPC
- Each client generates fragments locally
- Deterministic enough for visual consistency
- No bandwidth overhead for fragments

## 🔧 How It Works

### When an item breaks:

1. **Server detects break** (in `OnItemBroken`)
2. **Server calls** `RpcFractureMesh` (all clients)
3. **Each client:**
   - Hides original object
   - Gets mesh and material
   - Calls `MeshFracturer.FractureMesh()`
   - Spawns fragments as GameObjects
   - Applies physics and forces
4. **Fragments:**
   - Fall and collide with environment
   - Auto-destroy after lifetime
   - Fade out near end

### Fracturing Algorithm:

1. Start with original mesh
2. Generate random cutting plane (biased toward impact)
3. Split each fragment:
   - Classify vertices (positive/negative side)
   - Split triangles crossing plane
   - Generate cap geometry
4. Repeat 2-5 times (creates 4-32 fragments)
5. Return final fragment meshes

## 📊 Comparison: Old vs New

| Feature | Old VFX System | New Mesh Fracturing |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Visual | Particle shards | Real mesh pieces |
| Physics | None (visual only) | Full physics simulation |
| Collision | No collision | Collides with environment |
| Customization | Shard count, speed | Piece count, force, lifetime |
| Performance | Very light | Moderate (6-20 GameObjects) |
| Realism | Low | High |
| Network | Client-side | Client-side |

## 🎮 Inspector Settings

All settings in `GrabbableItem` component:

```
Mesh Fracture Settings
├─ Fracture Count (6-20)          # Number of pieces
├─ Fracture Explosion Force       # How hard pieces fly apart  
├─ Fracture Explosion Radius      # Force distribution
├─ Fragment Lifetime              # How long pieces exist
└─ Server Destroy Delay           # Network cleanup timing
```

## ⚠️ Important Requirements

### Mesh Read/Write Must Be Enabled
For every item mesh:
1. Select mesh asset
2. Check "Read/Write Enabled"  
3. Click Apply

**Why?** Runtime mesh access requires CPU-side mesh data.

### Mesh Requirements
- Must have valid geometry (triangles)
- Must have MeshFilter + MeshRenderer
- Convex meshes work best
- Complex meshes (1000+ tris) may be slower

## 🚀 Performance Guidelines

### Recommended Settings:

**Small items** (cups, bottles):
- Fracture Count: 6-8
- Lifetime: 3-5s

**Medium items** (boxes, vases):  
- Fracture Count: 10-12
- Lifetime: 4-6s

**Large items** (furniture):
- Fracture Count: 15-20
- Lifetime: 5-8s

### Performance Limits:
- **Max simultaneous fractures:** 5-10 items
- **Max pieces per item:** 20 (hard limit in Inspector)
- **Fragment lifetime:** Keep under 10 seconds

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Not deterministic across clients**
   - Each client generates slightly different fragments
   - Visual only - doesn't affect gameplay
   - Normal for client-side effects

2. **Mesh must be readable**
   - Unity import setting required
   - Shows error if not enabled

3. **Complex meshes are slower**
   - Algorithm is O(n*m) where n=triangles, m=cuts
   - Recommend keeping items under 1000 triangles

4. **Fragments don't network**
   - Not synchronized across clients
   - Intentional for performance
   - Fine for visual effects

5. **Plane-based slicing**
   - Not true Voronoi fracturing
   - Good enough for game purposes
   - Much faster than alternatives

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- **Pre-fractured mesh caching**: Generate once, reuse
- **Voronoi fracturing**: More realistic patterns
- **Sound effects**: Breaking sounds per material
- **Particle dust**: Visual polish on break
- **LOD fragments**: Lower detail pieces for performance
- **Impact decals**: Marks where object hit
- **Persistent debris**: Some pieces stay in world

## 🎯 Next Steps for User

1. **Open Unity Editor**
2. **Enable Read/Write** on all item meshes:
   - Select mesh asset in Project
   - Inspector → Read/Write Enabled ✓
   - Apply
3. **Enter Play Mode**
4. **Test fracturing**:

## 💡 Tips

- Start with default settings (10 pieces, 3 force)
- Increase piece count for dramatic breaks
- Reduce lifetime if performance issues
- Different impact angles create different patterns
- Throwing items breaks them more dramatically
- Fragments inherit item's physics layer
