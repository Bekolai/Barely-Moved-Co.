## Date: October 18, 2025

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve networking issues in the Barely Moved Co. multiplayer system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Client Lobby UI Not Showing After Joining
**Problem:** When a client clicked "Join" and entered an IP address, they would join the server successfully but remain stuck on the IP input panel. The lobby UI would not show.

**Root Cause:** The `MainMenuManager.JoinGame()` method was calling `ShowLobby()` immediately after calling `NetworkManager.JoinGame()`, but the client hadn't actually connected to the server yet. This meant the UI was trying to update before the network connection was established.

**Solution:**
- Added `OnClientConnectedToServer` event to `BarelyMovedNetworkManager`
- Made `MainMenuManager` subscribe to this event
- Removed immediate `ShowLobby()` call from `JoinGame()` 
- Now `ShowLobby()` is called via the event handler after the client successfully connects

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Network/BarelyMovedNetworkManager.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/GameManagement/MainMenuManager.cs`

### 2. ‚úÖ Client Players Cannot Interact with Zones
**Problem:** Only the host could interact with job boards and finish zones. Clients would see the "Press F to interact" prompt but nothing would happen when they pressed the interact button.

**Root Cause:** The interaction flow had a critical flaw:
1. `PlayerInteractionSystem` (running on client) would call `TryInteract(netId)` on the zone
2. The zone's `TryInteract()` method checked if the player was in `m_PlayersInRange` HashSet
3. **However**, `m_PlayersInRange` is only populated by `OnTriggerEnter()` which has `if (!isServer) return;`
4. This meant clients never populated their local `m_PlayersInRange`, so the check always failed

**Solution:**
- Converted `TryInteract()` into a Command that executes on the server
- Created new `CmdTryInteract()` method that runs on the server where `m_PlayersInRange` is correctly populated
- The public `TryInteract()` method now just sends the Command to the server
- Server validates the interaction and sends RPC back to clients

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Interactables/LevelFinishZone.cs`
- `Assets/Scripts/Interactables/JobBoardZone.cs`

**Code Changes:**
```csharp
// OLD (broken for clients):
public void TryInteract(uint _playerNetId)
{
    if (!m_PlayersInRange.Contains(_playerNetId)) // Empty on client!
    {
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}

// NEW (works for all clients):
public void TryInteract(uint _playerNetId)
{
    // Send command to server to validate and process
    CmdTryInteract(_playerNetId);
}

[Command(requiresAuthority = false)]
private void CmdTryInteract(uint _playerNetId)
{
    // Validate on server (where m_PlayersInRange is correctly populated)
    if (!m_PlayersInRange.Contains(_playerNetId))
    {
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of logic
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Steam Integration for Player Names and Avatars
**Problem:** The lobby was showing generic player names like "Player 1", "Player 2" instead of actual Steam usernames and avatars.

**Solution:**
Created a new `NetworkPlayerData` component that:
- Fetches Steam username and ID when a local player spawns
- Syncs this data across all clients using SyncVars
- Loads Steam avatars on each client based on the synced Steam ID
- Provides events to notify UI when player data updates

Updated `LobbyPlayerUI` to:
- Display actual Steam usernames instead of generic names
- Show Steam avatars next to player names
- Automatically update when new players join or data changes
- Fall back to generic names when Steam is not available

**Files Created:**
- `Assets/Scripts/Player/NetworkPlayerData.cs` - New component for player data syncing

**Files Modified:**
- `Assets/Scripts/UI/LobbyPlayerUI.cs` - Updated to display Steam data

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Steam nickname display
- ‚úÖ Steam avatar display (if available)
- ‚úÖ Fallback to generic names when Steam unavailable
- ‚úÖ Automatic updates when player data changes
- ‚úÖ Crown emoji (üèÜ) for host in player list

## Setup Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Add NetworkPlayerData to Player Prefab:**
   - Open your player prefab
   - Add the `NetworkPlayerData` component alongside `NetworkPlayerController`
   - The component will automatically fetch and sync Steam data

2. **Test Without Steam:**
   - The system gracefully falls back to random player names when Steam is unavailable
   - Format: "Player_XXXX" where XXXX is a random number

3. **Test With Steam:**
   - Make sure `SteamManager` is in your scene
   - Run the game with Steam client running
   - Player names and avatars will automatically load from Steam

### For Artists/UI Designers

The lobby UI now supports:
- **Player Slots:** Each slot can display:
  - Player name (from Steam or fallback)
  - Avatar image (40x40 pixels, loaded from Steam)
  - Status indicator (crown for host, checkmark for others)
  
- **Custom Slot Prefabs:** You can assign a prefab to `LobbyPlayerUI.m_PlayerSlotPrefab`
  - Must contain a `TextMeshProUGUI` for the name
  - Optionally a `RawImage` for the avatar

## Known Limitations

1. **Steam Avatar Loading:** 
   - Avatars are loaded asynchronously from Steam
   - There may be a brief delay before avatars appear
   - If Steam hasn't cached the avatar yet, it won't show

2. **Main Menu Player Spawning:**
   - Players don't spawn in MainMenu (by design)
   - NetworkPlayerData requires the player object to exist
   - Names/avatars won't show in MainMenu lobby (players spawn in PrepScene)

3. **Disconnection Handling:**
   - If a player disconnects, their slot should clear
   - This happens automatically but may take 1-2 seconds

- [ ] Add kick player functionality (host only)
- [ ] Add player color selection
- [ ] Show ping/latency for each player
- [ ] Add chat system in lobby
