```

### MainMenuManager.cs
```csharp
// CHANGED: HostGame() now transitions directly to prep
public void HostGame()
{
    m_NetworkManager.StartHosting();
    GameStateManager.Instance.TransitionToPrep(); // Directly to prep!
}

// CHANGED: Client joining goes directly to host's scene
private void OnClientConnectedToServer()
{
    // No ShowLobby() - client joins host's scene directly
}
```

## Unity Setup Required

### 1. Create Pause Menu in Prep Scene
```
Hierarchy:
Canvas
└── PauseMenuRoot (inactive by default)
    ├── Add Component: PauseMenuManager
    ├── Background Panel (semi-transparent)
    └── LobbyPanel
        ├── Add Component: InGameLobbyPanel
        ├── PlayerListContainer (Vertical Layout Group)
        └── PlayerCountText (TextMeshProUGUI)
```

**Assign References:**
- PauseMenuManager:
  - `m_PauseMenuRoot` → PauseMenuRoot GameObject
  - `m_LobbyPanel` → LobbyPanel
  - `m_PauseKey` → Escape
  
- InGameLobbyPanel:
  - `m_PlayerListContainer` → PlayerListContainer Transform
  - `m_PlayerCountText` → PlayerCountText
  - `m_MaxPlayers` → 4

### 2. Repeat for Level Scene
Copy the same pause menu setup to your level scene(s).

### 3. Test!
- **Host**: Click Host → Should load prep scene immediately
- **Client**: Join → Should load into host's scene
- **Both**: Press ESC → See connected players
- **Host**: See kick buttons, click to kick

## Code Flow

### When Host Clicks "Host"
```
MainMenuManager.HostGame()
    └─> NetworkManager.StartHosting()
    └─> GameStateManager.TransitionToPrep()
         └─> Server loads PrepScene
         └─> NetworkConnectionTracker spawns
         └─> Host spawns in prep
```

### When Client Joins
```
MainMenuManager.JoinGame(address)
    └─> NetworkManager.StartClient()
         └─> Mirror connects to server
         └─> Mirror auto-loads client to server's scene
         └─> Client spawns in current scene (prep or level)
```

### When Player Presses ESC
```
PauseMenuManager.Update()
    └─> Detects ESC key
    └─> Shows pause menu
         └─> InGameLobbyPanel.OnEnable()
              └─> Subscribes to NetworkConnectionTracker events
              └─> Refreshes player list
                   └─> Finds all NetworkPlayerData objects
                   └─> Creates UI entries with names, avatars, kick buttons
```

### When Host Clicks Kick
```
InGameLobbyPanel.OnKickButtonClicked(playerData)
    └─> Gets NetworkConnectionToClient from player
    └─> Calls NetworkManager.KickPlayer(conn)
         └─> conn.Disconnect()
              └─> Client disconnects
              └─> Client returns to main menu
              └─> Host's tracker updates
              └─> All clients refresh their lobby panels
```
