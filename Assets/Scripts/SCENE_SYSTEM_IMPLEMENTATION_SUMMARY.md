## Flow Diagram

### Main Menu → Prep
```
Player clicks "Host Game"
  → MainMenuManager.HostGame()
  → BarelyMovedNetworkManager.StartHosting()
  → Lobby shown with player list
  
Host clicks "Start Game"
  → MainMenuManager.StartGame()
  → GameStateManager.TransitionToPrep()
  → NetworkManager.ServerChangeScene("PrepScene")
  → Players spawn in PrepScene
  → State = PrepHub
```

### Prep → Level
```
Players interact with Job Board
  → JobSelectionUI.ShowJobBoard()
  → Select job
  
Host clicks "Start Job"
  → JobSelectionUI.OnStartJobClicked()
  → PrepSceneManager.StartJob()
  → GameStateManager.TransitionToLevel()
  → NetworkManager.ServerChangeScene("SampleScene")
  → Players spawn in Level
  → JobManager.StartJob() auto-called
  → State = InLevel
```

### Level → Prep
```
Job completes
  → JobManager.ManualCompleteJob()
  → OnJobCompleted event
  → SceneTransitionManager.HandleJobCompleted()
  → Calculate results → LevelResultsData
  → After delay:
  → GameStateManager.TransitionBackToPrep()
  → NetworkManager.ServerChangeScene("PrepScene")
  → Players spawn back in PrepScene
  → State = PrepHub
```

## Key Features

### 🎮 Multiplayer Support
- **Host-Client Model**: Host controls all scene transitions
- **Player Spawning**: Scene-aware spawning (no spawn in MainMenu)
- **State Sync**: All clients receive state updates via SyncVar
- **Lobby System**: Shows connected players in real-time

### 🔄 Scene Transitions
- **Server-Authoritative**: Only server can trigger transitions
- **Automatic State Updates**: GameStateManager notified on each scene load
- **Data Persistence**: LevelResultsData survives scene transitions
- **Graceful Handling**: NetworkManager persists through all scenes

### 🎨 UI System
- **Cursor Management**: Auto locks/unlocks based on UI state
- **Input Control**: Disables player input when UI is open
- **Host-Only Actions**: Start game, start job only available to host
- **Dynamic Updates**: Player list updates automatically

### 🏗️ Extensibility
- **Modular Design**: Each scene has its own manager
- **Easy Job Addition**: JobSelectionUI uses arrays for easy job setup
- **Upgrade System Ready**: Placeholder methods for upgrades, customization
- **Multiple Levels**: Architecture supports multiple level scenes

## Testing Steps

### Single Player Test:
1. Start game in MainMenu
2. Click "Host Game"
3. Verify lobby shows 1 player
4. Click "Start Game"
5. Should load PrepScene
6. Open job board (UI or interaction)
7. Select job, click "Start Job"
8. Should load LevelScene
9. Complete job or use finish zone
10. Should return to PrepScene

### Multiplayer Test:
1. **Host**: Start game, click "Host Game"
2. **Client**: Start game, enter IP, click "Join"
3. Verify both see each other in lobby
4. **Host**: Click "Start Game"
5. Both should transition to PrepScene
6. **Host**: Start a job
7. Both should transition to LevelScene
8. Complete job
9. Both should return to PrepScene

## Known Limitations / TODO

### Current Limitations:
- ⚠️ Upgrade shop not implemented (placeholder)
- ⚠️ Customization not implemented (placeholder)
- ⚠️ Only 3 sample jobs (hardcoded in JobSelectionUI)
- ⚠️ No loading screen during transitions
- ⚠️ No results screen after job completion
- ⚠️ Player ready system not implemented
- ⚠️ No lobby chat

### Future Enhancements:
- 📋 Implement proper job data system (ScriptableObjects)
- 💰 Implement upgrade shop with persistent money
- 🎨 Implement character customization
- 📊 Create results screen with detailed breakdown
- 🔄 Add loading screen for scene transitions
- ✅ Add ready-up system in lobby
- 💬 Add text chat in lobby
- 🎯 Multiple level scenes with different layouts
- 💾 Save system for persistent progression

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Players not spawning in PrepScene"
- Check PrepSceneManager has spawn points assigned
- Verify player prefab is assigned in NetworkManager
- Ensure BarelyMovedNetworkManager.m_SpawnPlayersInMainMenu is false

### "Scene not transitioning"
- Check all 3 scenes are in Build Settings
- Verify GameStateManager exists (should be in MainMenu, persists)
- Ensure you're the host when clicking "Start Game" or "Start Job"
- Check console for networking errors

### "UI not responding"
- Verify EventSystem exists in scene
- Check button onClick events are assigned
- Ensure Canvas Raycast Target is enabled

### "Compilation error: PrepSceneManager not found"
- Unity may need time to compile new scripts
- Try: Edit → Preferences → External Tools → Regenerate project files
- Restart Unity if error persists

// Methods (Server only)
.TransitionToPrep()            // Main Menu → Prep
.TransitionToLevel()           // Prep → Level
.TransitionBackToPrep()        // Level → Prep

## Networking Notes

- **Authority**: All scene transitions are server-authoritative
- **Persistence**: NetworkManager and GameStateManager use DontDestroyOnLoad
- **Spawning**: Players only spawn in Prep and Level scenes, not Main Menu
- **Sync**: Game state is synced via SyncVar to all clients
- **Commands**: Use [Command] for client→server requests (e.g., starting jobs)
- **ClientRpc**: Use [ClientRpc] for server→client notifications

---

## Success Criteria ✅

The 3-scene system is successfully implemented when:
- ✅ Players can host/join in MainMenu
- ✅ Host can transition all players to PrepScene
- ✅ Players spawn correctly in PrepScene
- ✅ Job board UI works in PrepScene
- ✅ Host can start jobs and transition to LevelScene
- ✅ Players spawn correctly in LevelScene
- ✅ Job completion returns players to PrepScene
- ✅ All transitions work in multiplayer
- ✅ State is properly synced across clients

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All core systems implemented and ready for testing

**Next Steps**: 
1. Set up scenes in Unity Editor following THREE_SCENE_SYSTEM_SETUP.md
2. Create UI elements and assign references
3. Test single-player flow
4. Test multiplayer flow
5. Implement future enhancements (upgrades, customization, etc.)
