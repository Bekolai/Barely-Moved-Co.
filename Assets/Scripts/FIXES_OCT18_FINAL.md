# Final Fixes - October 18, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Kick Button Not Showing for Local Testing
**Problem**: When testing locally (host + 1 client), kick buttons weren't showing up

**Root Cause**: Logic was correct but hard to debug without logs

**Fix**:
- Added detailed debug logs to show kick button visibility logic
- Shows: `isHost`, `isLocalPlayer`, `isServer`, `showKick` for each player
- This will help identify if buttons are hidden due to wrong flags

**Expected Logs** (when host opens ESC menu):
```
[InGameLobbyPanel] Player: YourName, isHost:True, isLocalPlayer:True, isServer:True, showKick:False
[InGameLobbyPanel] Player: YourName, isHost:True, isLocalPlayer:False, isServer:False, showKick:True
```

The second entry (client player) should show `showKick:True` and the kick button should be visible!

### 2. ✅ Player Movement Not Locked During Pause
**Problem**: Players could still move and look around when pause menu was open

**Fix**:
- Added `m_LockPlayerInput` setting (default: true)
- Pause menu now finds local player and calls `DisableInput()` when opening
- Calls `EnableInput()` when closing
- Works by disabling the `PlayerInput` component

**Files Changed**:
- `PauseMenuManager.cs` - Added `LockPlayerInput()` and `UnlockPlayerInput()` methods
- Uses `PlayerInputHandler.DisableInput()` / `EnableInput()`

**How It Works**:
1. Player presses ESC
2. Pause menu finds local NetworkPlayerData (`isLocalPlayer`)
3. Gets PlayerInputHandler component
4. Calls `DisableInput()` → movement stops
5. Player closes menu → Calls `EnableInput()` → movement resumes

### 3. ✅ Steam Avatar Not Displaying
**Problem**: Steam names showed up but avatars didn't load

**Root Causes**:
1. Avatar loading is **async** - `GetLargeFriendAvatar()` returns -1 while loading
2. No Steam callback handler to detect when avatar finished loading
3. SyncVar for Steam ID didn't have a hook to trigger loading on clients

**Fixes**:
- Added `m_AvatarImageLoadedCallback` - Steam callback for async avatar loading
- Added `OnSteamIdChanged()` SyncVar hook to load avatar when ID is synced
- Added `OnAvatarImageLoaded()` callback handler
- Split avatar processing into `ProcessAvatarImage()` for reuse
- Added extensive debug logging to track avatar loading stages

**Debug Logs to Watch For**:
```
[NetworkPlayerData] Attempting to load avatar for Steam ID: 76561198XXX
[NetworkPlayerData] Avatar handle: -1 (-1=loading, 0=no avatar, >0=valid)
[NetworkPlayerData] Avatar not yet loaded, waiting for callback...
[NetworkPlayerData] Avatar callback received for Steam ID: 76561198XXX, handle: 1
[NetworkPlayerData] Avatar size: 184x184
[NetworkPlayerData] Successfully loaded Steam avatar for YourName (76561198XXX)
```

**How It Works Now**:
1. Player's Steam ID syncs to all clients via SyncVar
2. `OnSteamIdChanged()` hook calls `LoadSteamAvatar()`
3. First attempt: `GetLargeFriendAvatar()` returns -1 (loading)
4. Steam loads avatar in background
5. `OnAvatarImageLoaded()` callback fires
6. `ProcessAvatarImage()` creates Texture2D
7. Fires `OnPlayerDataUpdated` event
8. UI refreshes and shows avatar!

## Code Changes Summary

### InGameLobbyPanel.cs
```csharp
// ADDED: Debug logging for kick button visibility
Debug.Log($"[InGameLobbyPanel] Player: {_playerData.PlayerName}, isHost:{_isHost}, isLocalPlayer:{_playerData.isLocalPlayer}, isServer:{_playerData.isServer}, showKick:{showKick}");
```

### PauseMenuManager.cs
```csharp
// ADDED: Player input locking
[SerializeField] private bool m_LockPlayerInput = true;
private PlayerInputHandler m_LocalPlayerInput;

// Lock input when pausing
if (m_LockPlayerInput)
{
    LockPlayerInput();
}

// Unlock when resuming
if (m_LockPlayerInput)
{
    UnlockPlayerInput();
}

// Helper methods
private void LockPlayerInput() { ... }
private void UnlockPlayerInput() { ... }
```

### NetworkPlayerData.cs
```csharp
// ADDED: Steam callback handler
#if !DISABLESTEAMWORKS
private Callback<AvatarImageLoaded_t> m_AvatarImageLoadedCallback;
#endif

// ADDED: Hook for Steam ID changes
[SyncVar(hook = nameof(OnSteamIdChanged))]
private ulong m_SteamId = 0;

// NEW: Callback setup
m_AvatarImageLoadedCallback = Callback<AvatarImageLoaded_t>.Create(OnAvatarImageLoaded);

// NEW: SyncVar hook
private void OnSteamIdChanged(ulong _oldId, ulong _newId)
{
    if (_newId != 0 && !m_AvatarLoaded)
    {
        LoadSteamAvatar(_newId);
    }
}

// NEW: Callback handler
private void OnAvatarImageLoaded(AvatarImageLoaded_t _callback)
{
    if (_callback.m_steamID.m_SteamID != m_SteamId) return;
    if (_callback.m_iImage > 0)
    {
        ProcessAvatarImage(_callback.m_iImage, m_SteamId);
    }
}

// NEW: Separated processing method
private void ProcessAvatarImage(int _avatarHandle, ulong _steamId) { ... }
```

## Testing Guide

### Test 1: Kick Button Visibility

1. **Start as Host**
2. **Second instance joins as Client**
3. **Host presses ESC**
4. **Check Console Logs**:
   ```
   [InGameLobbyPanel] Player: HostName, isHost:True, isLocalPlayer:True, isServer:True, showKick:False
   [InGameLobbyPanel] Player: ClientName, isHost:True, isLocalPlayer:False, isServer:False, showKick:True
   ```
5. **Visual Check**: Kick button should be visible next to client's name (not host's name)

**If kick button still not showing**:
- Check if button is being created (check InGameLobbyPanel prefab or auto-creation)
- Verify button isn't hidden behind another UI element
- Check button's RectTransform sizeDelta (should be ~80x30)

---

### Test 2: Input Locking

1. **Start game (host or client)**
2. **Move around** - character should move
3. **Press ESC** - pause menu opens
4. **Try to move** - character should NOT move!
5. **Check Console**:
   ```
   [PauseMenuManager] Paused
   [PauseMenuManager] Player input locked
   ```
6. **Try camera look** - should NOT work
7. **Press ESC again** - menu closes
8. **Check Console**:
   ```
   [PauseMenuManager] Player input unlocked
   [PauseMenuManager] Resumed
   ```
9. **Move around** - character should move again!

**If input not locking**:
- Check "Lock Player Input" is enabled in PauseMenuManager
- Verify local player was found (check console for "Could not find local player")
- Make sure PlayerInputHandler component exists on player prefab

---

### Test 3: Steam Avatar Loading

1. **Start Steam** (must be logged in)
2. **Start game as host**
3. **Check Console for your avatar**:
   ```
   [NetworkPlayerData] Local player Steam name: YourName, ID: 76561198XXX
   [NetworkPlayerData] Attempting to load avatar for Steam ID: 76561198XXX
   [NetworkPlayerData] Avatar handle: X (should be >0 or -1)
   ```

4. **If handle is -1 (loading)**:
   ```
   [NetworkPlayerData] Avatar not yet loaded, waiting for callback...
   [NetworkPlayerData] Avatar callback received for Steam ID: 76561198XXX, handle: 1
   [NetworkPlayerData] Avatar size: 184x184
   [NetworkPlayerData] Successfully loaded Steam avatar
   ```

5. **Join with second client**
6. **Press ESC on both** - should see avatars!

**Expected Results**:
- Host avatar shows immediately (or after callback)
- Client sees host's avatar
- Host sees client's avatar
- All avatars are Steam profile pictures

**If avatars not showing**:
- Check console for error messages
- Verify Steam is initialized: Look for `[SteamManager]` logs
- Check if avatar handle is 0 (no avatar set on Steam account)
- Verify `m_AvatarLoaded` becomes true
- Check UI: RawImage component should have texture assigned

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not find local player to lock input"
**Cause**: PauseMenuManager couldn't find the local player  
**Fix**: 
- Make sure player prefab has NetworkPlayerData component
- Verify player spawned with `isLocalPlayer = true`
- Check if player exists in scene when pause is pressed

### Issue: "Cannot load avatar - Steam ID is 0"
**Cause**: Steam ID never got set  
**Fix**:
- Verify Steam is initialized
- Check `OnStartLocalPlayer()` is being called
- Ensure `CmdSetPlayerData()` is executing on server

### Issue: Avatar handle always returns -1
**Cause**: Steam avatar is loading but callback never fires  
**Fix**:
- Verify `m_AvatarImageLoadedCallback` is created
- Check if callback is being created on ALL clients, not just local player
- Wait a few seconds - sometimes Steam takes time

### Issue: Kick button shows for everyone/no one
**Cause**: `isHost`, `isLocalPlayer`, or `isServer` flags incorrect  
**Fix**:
- Check debug logs to see actual flag values
- Verify `NetworkServer.active` is true only on host
- Ensure `isLocalPlayer` is true only for your player
- Check `isServer` is true only for host's player object
