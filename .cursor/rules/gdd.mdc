üéÆ Game Design Document ‚Äî Barely Moved Co.
1. High Concept

A chaotic co-op moving simulator where players work for a two-person moving company. The goal? Move furniture, boxes, and fragile items out of ridiculous houses without destroying everything‚Äîor each other.
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúOvercooked‚Äù meets ‚ÄúMoving Out‚Äù with heavier physics, slapstick mishaps, and light progression.

Tagline:

‚ÄúMove fast. Break nothing. Argue constantly.‚Äù

2. Core Pillars

Co-op Chaos:
Every item is a disaster waiting to happen. Players must communicate‚Äîor yell‚Äîto move it safely.

Physical Comedy:
Physics-driven gameplay where mistakes are funny, not frustrating.

Progression Through Upgrades:
Earn cash to buy gear that makes future jobs easier or safer.

Replayable Jobs:
Each mission can be replayed for better time, money, or zero-damage bonuses.

3. Gameplay Overview
Core Loop

Accept a moving job from the company board.

Enter the level (house, office, etc.).

Move all required items to the truck within the time limit.

Get paid based on time, condition, and completion.

Spend earnings on upgrades and cosmetic items.

Moment-to-Moment Gameplay

Grab/Carry Items:

Small items (1 person) ‚Üí can be carried freely.

Large items (2 person) ‚Üí both players must grab; movement syncs to physics constraints.

Damage System:

Each item has a value.

Collisions with walls, drops, or throws reduce its value.

Completely broken = zero value (and funny ragdoll effect).

Time Pressure:

A timer counts down. Finishing before time ends grants bonuses.

Optional Chaos Events:

Dog steals socks.

Floor breaks under heavy objects.

Moving truck slowly rolls downhill if left open.

4. Controls (Third-Person)
Action	Input (Default)
Move	WASD / Left Stick
Look	Mouse / Right Stick
Grab / Drop	E / RT
Jump	Space / A
Throw (if carrying)	Left Click / LT
Interact (doors, switches)	F / X
Sprint	Shift / B
5. Progression & Upgrades
Category	Examples
Equipment	Fragile Protection Case, Stronger Gloves (faster carry), Trolley/Cart, Rope Tie
Cosmetics	Hats, Uniforms, Truck Paint Jobs
Company Level	Unlock harder jobs, bigger houses, new regions
Vehicle Upgrades	Faster loading time, better brakes
6. Art & Visual Style

Camera: Third-person, slightly behind and above player.

Style: Stylized semi-realistic or simple toon-shaded (low cost, readable chaos).

Moodboard Keywords: Moving Out, Human Fall Flat, Totally Reliable Delivery Service, simple soft lighting.

Animations: Emphasize clumsiness and exaggerated motion.

7. Technical Details
Aspect	Notes
Engine	Unity (URP recommended for performance)
Physics	Rigidbody-based grab + joint constraints
Networking Mirror (free, open source)

Host-client model works perfectly.

Steamworks integration possible with a small wrapper.

Simple to sync player transforms, object states, and physics events.

Input System	Unity‚Äôs New Input System for easy controller support
Save System	Simple JSON or ScriptableObject-based persistent company data
8. Level Design

Job Types: House ‚Üí Office ‚Üí Luxury Villa ‚Üí Warehouse

Difficulty Curve:

Early: Simple layouts, light items.

Mid: Narrow hallways, obstacles.

Late: Multi-floor chaos (elevators, pets, hazards).

Bonus Objectives:

‚ÄúNo broken items‚Äù

‚ÄúFinish under 2 minutes‚Äù

‚ÄúCollect secret item‚Äù

9. Target Audience

Party game fans, couch co-op players.

Streamers looking for chaos content.

Casual players who enjoy physics-driven humor.

10. Monetization (if needed later)

Base game (paid).

Cosmetic DLC packs (skins, vehicles, furniture themes).

Optional co-op challenge modes as free updates.

11. MVP (Minimum Viable Prototype)

Goal: Deliver a few furniture items into a truck without breaking them.

Required Systems:

Player movement (third person).

Grab/release physics objects.

Breakable item system (health/value).

Delivery truck with collision trigger.

Basic scoring UI.

12. Lobby Flow - Network

Player A creates a lobby (becomes host).

Player B/C/D receive Steam invite ‚Üí join Player A‚Äôs lobby.

Host handles physics authority:

All rigidbody/item movement is simulated on host.

Clients send input (movement, grab/release actions).

Sync important states:

Player positions & rotations

Grabbed item states (who is grabbing, item transform)

Item damage/condition changes

Delivery truck interactions
